# Wolfram Mathematica 9: A Powerful System for Modern Technical Computing
 
Wolfram Mathematica is a comprehensive system for technical computing that covers a wide range of areas, such as neural networks, machine learning, image processing, geometry, data science, visualizations and more. Mathematica has been developing and expanding its capabilities for over three decades, providing a single integrated environment that is seamlessly available on desktop, cloud and mobile platforms.
 
In this article, we will explore some of the new features and enhancements that were introduced in Mathematica 9, the latest version of this remarkable system. Mathematica 9 adds major new areas of functionality, as well as improvements to existing ones, making it even more powerful and easy to use.

## The Wolfram Predictive Interface
 
One of the most innovative features of Mathematica 9 is the Wolfram Predictive Interface, which optimizes your workflow by predicting what you will want to do next. As soon as you finish a computation, you will get optimized suggestions about what to do next. You can press a button to evaluate a new function or bring up an interactive wizard. It's a new interface paradigm that lets you navigate and discover functionality throughout the Mathematica system.
 
The Wolfram Predictive Interface also includes a context-sensitive input assistant that provides intelligent autocompletion and highlighting for functions, options and other elements of Mathematica. You can also access the unrivaled documentation system of Mathematica directly from the input assistant.
 
## Social Network Analysis
 
Mathematica 9 introduces a full suite of social network analysis functionality, including community detection, cohesive groups, centrality measures and more. You can also import data from popular social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and more, and analyze them using Mathematica's powerful graph and network capabilities.

For example, you can use Mathematica to visualize your Facebook friends network, find out who are the most influential or connected people in your network, or identify communities based on shared interests or attributes.
 
## Systemwide Support for Units
 
Mathematica 9 provides highly integrated support for more than 4,500 units of measurement, including free-form linguistic entry, conversions and dimensional consistency checking across graphics and numeric and symbolic calculations. You can easily enter units using natural language or standard abbreviations, and Mathematica will automatically interpret them and perform the appropriate computations.
 
For example, you can use Mathematica to convert between different units of length, area, volume, mass, time, temperature and more. You can also plot functions or data with units, and Mathematica will automatically adjust the axes labels and scales accordingly.
 
## EnterpriseCDF Deployment
 
Mathematica 9 also introduces a new edition called Mathematica Enterprise Edition, which enables direct CDF deployment with live data at runtime and other enhanced features. CDF stands for Computable Document Format, which is a format that allows you to create interactive documents that can be viewed and manipulated in any web browser or on any desktop system.
 
With Mathematica Enterprise Edition, you can create CDF documents that can access live data from databases or web services at runtime, making them ideal for dynamic reports or dashboards. You can also preview your CDF documents in different modes that emulate Wolfram CDF Player and Wolfram Player Pro.
 
## Comprehensive Support for Random Processes
 
Mathematica 9 provides a generalized framework for modeling systems that evolve randomly over time, with support for simulation, estimation, slice distributions and mean and covariance functions. You can use Mathematica to model various types of random processes such as Markov chains, queues
