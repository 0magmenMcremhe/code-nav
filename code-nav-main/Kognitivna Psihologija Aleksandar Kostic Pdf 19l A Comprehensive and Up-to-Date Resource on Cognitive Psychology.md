## Perception
 
Perception is the process of acquiring and interpreting sensory information from the environment. Perception involves both bottom-up and top-down processing. Bottom-up processing refers to the analysis of sensory data based on their physical features. Top-down processing refers to the influence of prior knowledge, expectations, and context on perception. Perception is also affected by factors such as attention, motivation, and emotion.

Some of the questions that cognitive psychologists ask about perception are: How do we perceive colors, shapes, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures? How do we recognize faces, objects, scenes, and actions? How do we perceive depth, motion, and distance? How do we integrate information from different sensory modalities? How do we perceive illusions and ambiguous stimuli? How do we cope with noisy and incomplete sensory data?
 
## Memory
 
Memory is the process of encoding, storing, and retrieving information. Memory can be divided into different types and stages. One way to classify memory is based on the duration and capacity of storage. According to this classification, there are three types of memory: sensory memory, short-term memory (or working memory), and long-term memory. Sensory memory holds sensory information for a very brief period of time (less than a second). Short-term memory holds a limited amount of information (about 7 items) for a short period of time (about 15-30 seconds). Long-term memory holds a large amount of information for a long period of time (from minutes to years).
 
Another way to classify memory is based on the type and format of information. According to this classification, there are two types of long-term memory: declarative memory and non-declarative memory. Declarative memory (or explicit memory) involves conscious recollection of facts and events. Declarative memory can be further divided into two subtypes: semantic memory and episodic memory. Semantic memory stores general knowledge about the world, such as concepts, categories, rules, and facts. Episodic memory stores personal experiences that are tied to specific times and places. Non-declarative memory (or implicit memory) involves unconscious learning of skills and habits. Non-declarative memory can be further divided into several subtypes: procedural memory, priming, conditioning, and habituation.
 
Some of the questions that cognitive psychologists ask about memory are: How do we encode, store, and retrieve information in different types of memory? How do we organize and structure information in memory? How do we use strategies and mnemonics to improve memory? How do we forget and remember information? What are the causes and consequences of memory errors and distortions? How does memory change over time and across the lifespan?
