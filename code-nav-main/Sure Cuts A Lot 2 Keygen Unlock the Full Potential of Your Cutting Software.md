You can also show or hide layers, lock or unlock them, rename them, duplicate them, merge them, and change their order.
 
To access the layers panel in Sure Cuts A Lot 2, you can click on the View menu and select Layers, or press Ctrl+L on your keyboard. The layers panel will show up on the right side of your screen, where you can see all the layers in your project. You can also create new layers, delete layers, or change their properties from this panel. You can select a layer by clicking on its name or thumbnail, and you can drag and drop layers to rearrange them.
 
There are many ways to use layers in Sure Cuts A Lot 2. For example, you can use layers to design a 12 by 12 scrapbook layout with different elements, such as photos, frames, backgrounds, titles, and embellishments. You can add font characters or shapes from your library to each layer, and resize, rotate, move, align, or weld them as you wish. You can also use layers to create decals for your walls, windows, cars, or other surfaces. You can import and trace images from your computer or the internet, and convert them into cuttable shapes. You can then cut out your decals with your cutting machine and apply them to your desired surface.
