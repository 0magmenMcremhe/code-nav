# How to Load PS2 Games from CD with ELF Loader
 
If you have a PlayStation 2 console and some backup games on CD, you might want to use an ELF loader to run them without swapping discs or using a modchip. An ELF loader is a program that can launch executable files (ELF) from different devices, such as memory card, USB stick, hard drive or network share. In this article, we will show you how to use an ELF loader to load PS2 games from CD.

Before you start, you will need the following:
 
- A PlayStation 2 console (either fat or slim model)
- A memory card with Free McBoot installed (a software that allows you to run homebrew programs on PS2)
- An ELF loader of your choice (we recommend wLaunchELF, which is an open-source file manager and executable launcher for PS2)
- A CD/DVD drive connected to your PC (or a CD/DVD burner if you want to create your own backup discs)
- A PS2 backup game on CD (either original or burned)

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download wLaunchELF from [here](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/wLaunchELF) and extract the files to a folder on your PC.
2. Copy the BOOT.ELF file from the folder to the root of your memory card. You can use a USB adapter or a PS2 memory card reader to connect your memory card to your PC.
3. Insert your memory card into your PS2 and turn on the console. You should see the Free McBoot menu. Select wLaunchELF from the list of applications and press X.
4. You will see the wLaunchELF main menu. Press Circle to enter the FileBrowser mode.
5. Navigate to the cdrom0: device and press Circle. You will see the contents of your CD. Look for the file with the .ELF extension (usually named SLUS\_XXX.XX or SLES\_XXX.XX) and press R1.
6. Select Load ELF with Arguments from the menu and press Circle. You will see a confirmation screen. Press Start to launch the game.
7. Enjoy your game!

Note: Some games may not work properly with this method, depending on the compatibility of the ELF loader and the game. You can check the compatibility list [here](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/opl-open-ps2-loader.372/) for more information.
  
If you want to create your own backup discs, you will need to use a CD/DVD burner and a software that can burn PS2 games in ISO format. You can use ImgBurn, which is a free and easy-to-use tool for burning disc images. You can download ImgBurn from [here](https://www.imgburn.com/) and follow the instructions [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Burn-a-PlayStation-2-Game-Using-ImgBurn) to burn your PS2 games.
 
If you want to use a different ELF loader than wLaunchELF, you will need to find one that supports loading games from CD. Some examples of ELF loaders are Open PS2 Loader (OPL), which can also load games from HDD and SMB, and PS2 Packer, which can create packed ELF files to run on the PS2. You can download OPL from [here](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/opl-open-ps2-loader.372/) and PS2 Packer from [here](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2-packer). You will need to copy the ELF file of the loader to your memory card and launch it with Free McBoot.
