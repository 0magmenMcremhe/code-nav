## Conclusion
 
Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed Lightform Creator on your computer. Now you can start creating amazing projection mapping projects with your Lightform device. For more information and tutorials on how to use Lightform Creator, you can visit [Lightform's guide](https://guide.lightform.com/) or watch their videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg7xY0Zf0zvZ4w8Z8l5yJ6w).
  
## Step 5: Connect your Lightform device to your projector
 
Now that you have activated your license, you can connect your Lightform device to your projector using an HDMI cable. You can use any projector that has an HDMI input and supports at least 720p resolution. You can also use a wireless HDMI transmitter and receiver if you want to avoid long cables. Make sure your projector is plugged into a power outlet and turned on.
 
## Step 6: Scan your scene
 
The next step is to scan your scene using your Lightform device. A scan is a high-resolution image of your scene as seen from the projector's perspective. It helps you align your content with the physical objects in your scene and apply effects that are aware of the depth and shape of your scene. To scan your scene, you need to pair your Lightform device with Lightform Creator using Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Then, you can click on the Scan button in the software and wait for a few seconds until the scan is complete.
 
## Step 7: Create your content
 
The final step is to create your content using Lightform Creator. You can use the scan as a canvas to draw surfaces, which are regions of interest that you want to augment with projections. You can use different tools to create surfaces, such as rectangles, circles, polygons, or raster tools like magic wand and magic brush. You can also import images, videos, or slideshows and place them on your surfaces. Once you have created your surfaces, you can apply effects to them from the built-in library of Lightform Creator. You can choose from different categories of effects, such as generators, gradients, patterns, textures, or audio-reactive effects. You can also customize the parameters of each effect to suit your preferences.
 
## Step 8: Publish and enjoy
 
When you are happy with your content, you can publish it to your Lightform device by clicking on the Publish button in Lightform Creator. This will upload your content to the device's internal storage and start playing it on your projector. You can disconnect your computer from the device and enjoy your projection mapping show. You can also control your content using the Lightform remote app on your smartphone or tablet.
