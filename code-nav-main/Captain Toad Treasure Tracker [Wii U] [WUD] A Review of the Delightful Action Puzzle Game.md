The gameplay of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is similar to the "Adventures of Captain Toad" levels from Super Mario 3D World, where the player controls either Captain Toad or Toadette and must navigate through various obstacles and enemies to reach a Power Star at the end of each level. Unlike most Mario games, the characters cannot jump due to their heavy backpacks, so they must rely on their wits and the environment to solve puzzles and avoid danger. The player can also manipulate the camera angle to view the levels from different perspectives and reveal hidden items and secrets.
 
The game consists of three episodes, each containing 18 levels. The first episode focuses on Captain Toad's quest to rescue Toadette from Wingo, a giant bird who steals their treasure. The second episode switches the roles, as Toadette must save Captain Toad from Wingo. The third episode has both characters working together to defeat Wingo once and for all. The game also features bonus levels based on Super Mario 3D World and Super Mario Odyssey, which can be unlocked by completing certain objectives or using amiibo figures.
 
The game supports both single-player and two-player co-op modes. In single-player mode, the player uses the Wii U GamePad or the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers to interact with the levels and control the characters. In co-op mode, one player controls Captain Toad or Toadette while the other player assists them by using a pointer to stun enemies, collect coins, and manipulate objects. The game also features various collectibles and challenges, such as finding three Super Gems and completing a bonus objective in each level.
