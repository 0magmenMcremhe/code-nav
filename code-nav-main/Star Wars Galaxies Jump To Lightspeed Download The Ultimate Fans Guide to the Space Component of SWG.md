Star Wars Galaxies Jump to Lightspeed was released in 2004 as the first expansion pack for Star Wars Galaxies. It was developed by Sony Online Entertainment and LucasArts, and received positive reviews from critics and players. It added 10 new planets, 21 new starships, four new space professions, and over 100 new space missions to the game. It also introduced the Galactic Civil War in space, where players could join either the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire and fight for control of various sectors.
 
Star Wars Galaxies Jump to Lightspeed was followed by two more expansion packs: Rage of the Wookiees in 2005 and Trials of Obi-Wan in 2006. However, in 2011, Star Wars Galaxies was shut down by Sony Online Entertainment due to the expiration of their contract with LucasArts. Many fans were disappointed and saddened by the closure of the game, which had a loyal and passionate community.
