If you are looking for a way to make software development easy and fast, you might want to consider using a C DAL generator for SQL Server and MS Access databases. A C DAL generator is a .net desktop application that creates C# classes (one per table) that contain methods for CRUD operations. The generated code can be used in web as well as desktop applications.

In this article, we will show you how to use a C DAL generator by NajmulIqbal15, which is available on CodeCanyon. This C DAL generator supports SQL Server and MS Access databases, and handles data types, primary keys, nullable columns, identity columns, timestamp columns, sorting, and pagination. It also provides a sample web application that uses the generated code without any modification.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install the C DAL Generator
 
The first step is to download and install the C DAL generator from CodeCanyon. You can choose between two options: the app without source code[^1^], which costs $19, or the app with source code[^2^], which costs $29. The source code allows you to make changes according to your programming structure.
 
After downloading the zip file, extract it and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions to install the C DAL generator on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Connect to Your Database
 
The next step is to connect to your SQL Server or MS Access database. To do this, launch the C DAL generator and click on the "Connect" button. A dialog box will appear where you can choose the database type (SQL Server or MS Access), enter the connection string, and test the connection.
 
If you are using a SQL Server database, you can use the following connection string format:
 `Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;` 
If you are using a MS Access database, you can use the following connection string format:
 `Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\mydatabase.mdb;User Id=admin;Password=;` 
After entering the connection string, click on the "Test Connection" button to verify that it works. If it does, click on the "OK" button to close the dialog box.

## Step 3: Generate the C# Data Access Layer
 
The final step is to generate the C# data access layer for your database tables. To do this, select the tables that you want to generate code for from the list on the left side of the C DAL generator window. You can select multiple tables by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking on them.
 
Then, click on the "Generate Code" button on the right side of the window. A dialog box will appear where you can choose the folder where you want to save the generated code files. You can also specify a namespace for your classes.
 
Click on the "OK" button to start generating the code. The C DAL generator will create one C# class file per table, with methods for CRUD operations. The class file name will be based on the table name, with an ".cs" extension.
 
## Step 4: Use the Generated Code in Your Application
 
Now that you have generated the C# data access layer for your database tables, you can use it in your web or desktop application. To do this, simply add a reference to the generated code files in your project, and import the namespace that you specified when generating the code.
 
Then, you can create instances of your classes and call their methods to perform CRUD operations on your database tables. For example, if you have a table called "Employees" with columns "EmployeeID", "FirstName", "LastName", "Salary", and "HireDate", you can use the following code snippet to insert a new record:
 `// Create an instance of Employees class
Employees objEmployees = new Employees();
// Assign values to properties
objEmployees.FirstName = "John";
objEmployees.LastName = "Doe";
objEmployees.Salary = 50000; 8cf37b1e13
