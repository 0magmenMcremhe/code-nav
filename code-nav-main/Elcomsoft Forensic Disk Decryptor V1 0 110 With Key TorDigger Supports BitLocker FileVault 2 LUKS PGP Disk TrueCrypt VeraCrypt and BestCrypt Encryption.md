## Step 2: Choose an Access Mode
 
Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor offers two access modes: complete decryption and real-time access. You can choose either mode depending on your needs and preferences.
 
Complete decryption mode will decrypt the entire content of the encrypted volume and save it as an image file on your hard drive. This mode is slower but more thorough, as it allows you to access all the data on the encrypted volume without any limitations.
 
Real-time access mode will mount the encrypted volume as a new drive letter on your computer. This mode is faster but less reliable, as it depends on the availability and stability of the encryption key. You can access the data on the encrypted volume as if it were a normal drive, but some files or folders may be inaccessible or corrupted if the key is lost or changed.
 
## Step 3: Provide an Encryption Key
 
To access an encrypted volume, you need to provide an encryption key that matches the encryption algorithm and parameters used by the crypto container. There are several ways to obtain an encryption key:
 
- If you know the plain-text password that was used to encrypt the volume, you can enter it manually in the software.
- If you have a recovery key or an escrow key that was generated by BitLocker, FileVault 2, PGP Disk or TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt, you can load it from a file or enter it manually in the software.
- If you have a memory dump file that contains the encryption key, you can load it in the software. A memory dump file can be obtained from a RAM capture, a hibernation file or a page file of the computer that was used to encrypt or access the volume.

To choose an encryption key source, click on Tools > Select Encryption Key Source in the software. Then, browse for a file or enter a password or a key in the appropriate field.
 
## Step 4: Decrypt or Mount an Encrypted Volume
 
After providing an encryption key source, you can decrypt or mount an encrypted volume by clicking on Tools > Decrypt or Mount Disk in the software. Then, browse for an encrypted disk or container file
