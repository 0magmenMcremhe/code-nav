## New Taper and Wave Shape Strokes
 
One of the most exciting additions to After Effects 2020 is the ability to create round, wavy, and pointy shape strokes with the new parameters - Taper and Wave. You can also animate the strokes to create unique graphics that can be used for titles, logos, transitions, and more.
 
To use the new shape stroke features, you need to apply the Offset Paths shape effect to a shape layer. Then, you can adjust the Taper and Wave parameters to change the shape and appearance of the stroke. You can also keyframe these parameters to create dynamic animations.
 
For example, you can create a spiral shape by setting the Offset parameter to a high value and adding some taper. You can also add some wave to make the shape more interesting. Then, you can animate the Offset parameter to make the spiral spin.
 
Here is an example of what you can achieve with the new shape stroke features:

## New Offset Paths Parameters
 
Another new feature in After Effects 2020 is the ability to make copies of a path that radiate outward or inward using the new parameters in the Offset Paths shape effect. This can be useful for creating patterns, backgrounds, and other effects that require multiple copies of a path.
 
To use this feature, you need to apply the Offset Paths shape effect to a shape layer. Then, you can adjust the Copies and Offset parameters to control how many copies of the path are created and how far they are spaced from each other. You can also change the Miter Limit parameter to control how sharp or smooth the corners of the copies are.
